JavaScript is synchronous which means the JSEngine executes the code sequentially, one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of statements.

Asynchronous programming is a technique which enables the program to potentially start a long-running task and still be reaponsive to other events, while that task runs rather than having to wait for that task to finish.
